## Agile tools

I used a [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/dsouths/projects/3/views/1) for the development of this project, which made it possible to break down the project execution into subtasks and make it easier to complete and track project progress.  This is located in the GitHub Projects section

## Design and Site Structure

The site was based on the Gobarber template from the Figma Community site. The look of the site & fonts for the home page were borrowed from the template.
The main page layout can be seen below:

<details>
<summary>Happy Dental website design template </summary>

![Home page](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/9c671901-20f1-4833-84fb-ffde7c543783)

</details>
<br />

### Functional Structure

**Home page:** The home page contains a menu, clickable logo (returns to homepage) and an image that gives the user an idea of ​​the type of service provided i.e. a dental booking website. In the middle of the page there are links to register a new user or login for an existing user.

Signup and login are also available from the navigation bar.

**Signup page:** The user must create an account to make a reservation.
To do this, they are asked to fill out a form on the page with the required fields: username and password. There is also an optional email field.

**Login page:** A username and password are required to log in existing users.
The user can use the navigation menu or the link in the center of the home page.
After a successful login, the user receives a message prompt in the middle of the screen and is redirected to the page with their reservations. If the user has no bookings, then they see a message saying they have no bookings & gives a link to make a booking.

**Logout page:** Logging out of the account is done through the menu, after which the user is redirected to the logout page where they must confirm their request to log out of the account. After a successful logout, the user is returned to the home page and receives a message in the middle of the screen.

**Services page:** The page displays the services/treatments provided & cost of each service.  I have only included a small sample of possible treatments available at the dentist for illustrative purposes, this can be increased upon request of the owner of the dental booking app/dental surgery.

Clicking on the price of the selected service redirects the authorized user to the service booking page. An unauthorized user is prompted to register or log into an account before making a booking.

**Booknow page:** The Booknow page is only available to authenticated users.
The user is asked to fill out a form with the required fields - name, phone, service, preferred dentist, time and date, and an optional field - email.
After filling out the form, the user is redirected to the page of current bookings.

**Booking page:** Only authenticated users have access to the Booking page. The link to this page becomes visible in the navigation menu once a user is authenticated. Booking page shows to user information about made bookings and contains Change button and Delete button for manage booking.

**Change booking page:** This page is available only to authenticated users and has the same functionality and form as the Booknow page, where users can change booking details.

**Delete booking page:** This page is only available to authenticated users and has the same functionality and form as the Booknow page, where the user can change the booking details. The user has the ability to delete theur order by selecting the Delete button on the Booking page. After that, they will be redirected to the delete page where they need to confirm their request. After successfully deleting the booking, they will return to the Booking page and receive a message at center of the screen.

If the user changes their mind, they can return to the page by clicking on the Back to my Bookings button.

### Wireframes

I used canva to sketch out some wireframes for the design of the website. I believe wireframes are a great tool for:
- **Planning and Organization -** great way to determine key elements required
- **Conceptualization and Communication -** good as a starting point to discuss design with other developers on the project
- **Focus on Functionality -** focuses on core functionality allowing me to concentrate on usability & interaction of the user with the website
- **Feedback -** good to gather feedback & make any changes at initial design stage

**For Mobile view and small screens**

### Sign up page

To create an account user should fill in form provided on Sign up page.
![Sign up page](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/cc3b4213-fa4e-4d3a-8adb-36a4a35c243e)

![Login page](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/ce27ffa0-ee65-4478-b0bc-3c2fe889aaee)


## Treatments/Services page

The Services page provides information about all available barbershop services. User also can book necessary service straight from the Services page by clicking on the services price.

![treatments page](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/5c3ff8d5-1e7a-4cac-84cf-3ba808051abe)


## Book Now page

The Book Now button has a hover effect to provide a better user experience by creating feedback/call to action:


![Book Now button](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/0823f3e3-9527-48ac-adb2-4730f2a4330c)


Users must be logged in to make a booking. To book a service, the user must fill in the required fields in the form: name, phone, preferred dentist, services, date, time and an optional email field. The date field will not allow user to make a booking on a Saturday or Sunday as the dental practice is closed, & would create issues if user made a booking when the dentist was not there. I have created functionality when creating a new booking that a user cannot double book a dentist if they are already booked by another user.

#### Book Now page for the logged user

![book_now page (AUTHORISED USER)](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/36ca6e0a-91bc-49bc-9874-3b11357de2db)

## Testing

### Bugs

During this project I came across many bugs that took a lot of patience to fix. I have included some bugs & a small description of them & how I corrected them:

Initially I was deciding on a background image for my landing page & whether or not to use a logo in the center of the page.  The image was repeating & it did not look visually appealing to the user like this. I corrected this by including the following css code:
- background-repeat: no-repeat;
- background-position: center center;
- background-size: cover;

The positioning of the logo in relation to the login/create account was off & the login/create account button was lost in the background image. I decided to not use a logo here & created a box with background colour to enclose the login/create account to make it stand out to the user & improve the UX. 

![image](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/db345436-cb55-41cc-8cdf-324108216a12)


![image](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/77b6b05e-92d0-4da8-896f-3fa6246c0304)

When deploying to Heroku I had an issue with CSS not loading. This was due to having my cloudinary credentials incorrectly input. I also had to remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars on Heroku which fixed the issue


![image](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/acf4f1ca-ab78-4d6d-be54-d6fd7237f7bf)


This error also occured when debug was set to False initially. This was also due to Cloudinary credentials & the naming of the hosting of the CSS file in cloudinary


![image](https://github.com/dsouths/happydentalapp/assets/105642587/e7f394b5-b4fa-43a9-8992-833728658084)

## Validation

### HTML Validation:

The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the website.  I had an issue with W3 validator not recognizing Django code such as {% load static %} so I used the function CTRL + U to get the source code of my website & check it for errors using W3 validator.  I did this as it created errors and warnings in the reports about unclosed elements and tags, incorrect values and types of elements, unnecessary trailing slashes. All errors and warnings were corrected when validating the source code of each page

Initial errors when using W3 Validator to validate Django code

## Credits

### Code

I used the GoBarber app by LarisaLG as a basis & inspiration for my code, which was based on Gobarber template from the Figma Community site. I built on this code and added a custom model to select preferred dentist from a choice of three, have a default dentist, Dr Goodteeth, & added some other functionality like not allowing a double booking by two users & not allowing bookings for saturdays or sundays when the dental practice would be closed. 

I used the design of the GoBarber app as inspiration & modified it more to my taste & a more suitable styling for a dental booking app.

The structure and the code of the project were based on two walkthroughs by the Code Institute, which I found invaluable:

  * Hello Django - I created CRUD functionalities using this walkthrough.
  * From I think  therefore I blog -  I utilized confirmation messages code and also followed the site deployment steps as a reminder. 

Date picker field and minimum date validator taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/stasyao/99376eb0cf0ad3599f9737c421b5210e#part_4).

I used Stack Overflow, Slack & Google for research into code functionalities and problem solving. 


### Content

The site home page is based on the GoBarber app by LarisaLG who borrowed from the Figma community template. I changed the look of the home page & color palette used and tried to keep the rest of the pages in the same style.

- This project was inspired by the GoBarber app by LarisaLG, the Hello Django project and the I Think Therefore I Blog project.
- Website template from Gobarber app by LarisaLG & Figma community.
- As a source of inspiration for this project I used the real dental practice website [Truly Dental](https://trulydental.ie/). 
- LarisaLG & Aleksey Konovalov's Readme.md file was used as a template for writing Readme.md

### Acknowledgments

- The tutor support team at CI but it particular Holly who was a major help in fixing bugs relating to cloudinary & CSS issues - extremely patient & helpful, thank-you!
- My mentor Martina who is always there to help & answer my questions
- LarisaLG who created a great GoBarber app & inspired me to create the happydental booking app

Overall I found this project very challenging & rewarding. I took on board feedback from my previous projects & tried to incorporate the feedback in this project, in particular ensuring my commit messages are succinct & include commit messages for readme file. 

Thank you for your time!
